## Project documentation

## Problems with many code projects

- Parts of the documentation are outdated/incomplete
- Documentation workflows undocumented
- We typically program first and document later (or never)
- No manual for developers (first steps, call tree, where to start, what to do and what not to do)
- One documentation for different versions (either just confusing or documentation for
  older versions is just dropped)
- Have to read a lot of text in different places just to get started
- Keyword-driven (what is possible) instead of tutorial-driven (what is recommended)
- With some projects it is impossible to get a result after 5 minutes of reading
- Some scientific projects take pride in being inaccessible, hard to understand, undocumented, opaque

## Requirements for a useful documentation

- Close to the code (minimize barrier)
- Versions: If the project has versions, the documentation should too
- Lightweight markup (LaTeX is not lightweight enough)
- Readable on any device
- Division into tutorials and keyword reference
- Tutorials contain good defaults
- Ready examples that one can copy-paste to get quickly started
- Prose
- Written by humans
