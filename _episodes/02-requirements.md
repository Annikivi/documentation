## Close to the code

- Minimizes barrier to contribute

---

## Versions

- The project should be versioned (version control)
- If the project has versions, the documentation should too
- Reproducibility

---

## Lightweight markup (LaTeX is not lightweight enough)

- LaTeX is not lightweight enough
- Use RST or Markdown
- GitHub and GitLab automatically render README.md or README.rst files

---

## Readable on any device

- Many people browse the web on their phone or tablet

---

## Division into tutorials and keyword reference

- Tutorials contain good defaults
- Ready examples that one can copy-paste to get quickly started
