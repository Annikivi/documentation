## When you look at a code project for the first time, what are the things you look for?

- Website is the first thing I see
- Documentation often the second
- If both are repelling, I might get repelled
- Sometimes both are nonexistent
- How do you feel when you see that the documentation has not been updated since 2001?

## Motivation

### Project website

- Project website is important
- Companies without a website cannot exist
- Soon scientific projects without website will not be able to exist (or in other words get grants)
- A website is something that you can show when you apply for jobs

### Project documentation

- Documentation is important
- Writing and reading documentation can be fun
- Documentation does not have to be outdated/incomplete
- If the documentation is notoriously outdated/incomplete, it can mean
  that your documentation framework/workflow is not ideal
- It is not always the lazy programmer, sometimes it is the framework

## Why are so many websites so ugly?

## Why are so many websites so ugly?

- Many scientific websites look like websites created by scientists in the 90s
- Websites which are not suitable for phones
- Lance Armstrong: "It's not the bike it's the rider."
- Concerning documentation, sometimes it is not the rider, it is the bike
- Some projects simply use better tools
