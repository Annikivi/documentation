## Questions

- Why is project documentation important?
- How would you describe a useful documentation?
- Why are some projects lacking useful documentation?
- How can we motivate developers to contribute to the documentation?
- Why do some projects not have a website?
- Does your project have a website? If not, do you think it would be good for
  the project?

## Typical problems

- Many scientific websites look like websites created by scientists in the 90s.
- Websites which are not suitable for phones.
- Parts of the documentation are outdated/incomplete.
- Documentation workflows undocumented.
- We typically program first and document later (or never).
- No manual for developers (first steps, call tree, where to start, what to do and what not to do).
- One documentation for different versions (either just confusing or documentation for
  older versions is just dropped).
- Have to read a lot of text in different places just to get started.
- Keyword-driven (what is possible) instead of tutorial-driven (what is recommended).
- With some projects it is impossible to get a result after 5 minutes of reading.
- Some scientific projects take pride in being inaccessible, hard to understand, undocumented, opaque.
