## When you look at a code project for the first time, what are the things you look for?

- Website is often the contact with the project
- Documentation often the second
- If both are repelling, I might get repelled
- Sometimes both are nonexistent
- How do you feel when you see that the documentation has not been updated since 2001?

---

## Motivation to have a project website

- Project website is important
- Companies without a website cannot exist
- Soon scientific projects without website will not be able to exist (or in other words get grants)
- A website is something that you can show when you apply for jobs

---

## Why do some projects not have a website?

- Discuss why

---

## Typical problems

- Many scientific websites look like websites created by scientists in the 90s
- Websites which are not suitable for phones
- Lance Armstrong: "It's not the bike it's the rider."
- Concerning documentation, sometimes it is not the rider, it is the bike
- Some projects simply use better tools

## Motivation to have a project documentation

- Documentation is important - discuss why
- Writing and reading documentation can be fun
- Documentation does not have to be outdated/incomplete
- If the documentation is notoriously outdated/incomplete, it can mean
  that your documentation framework/workflow is not ideal
- It is not always the lazy programmer, sometimes it is the framework

## What are the features of a useful documentation?

- Discuss with the learners
- Also discuss why some projects lack useful documentation
