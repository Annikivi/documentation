title: "Motivation"
teaching: 10
exercises: 0
questions:
  - "Why is code documentation important?"
  - "Why does almost every project need a website?"
objectives:
  - "Discuss the need for documentation and a project website."
---

## When you look at a code project for the first time, what are the things you look for?

- Website is often the contact with the project
- Documentation often the second
- If both are repelling, we might get repelled
- Sometimes both are nonexistent
- How do you feel when you see that the documentation has not been updated since 2001?

---

## Motivation to have a project website

- Companies without a website cannot exist
- Soon scientific projects without website will not be able to exist (or in other words get grants)
- Project website is important for grant applications and project reports
- A website is something that you can show when you apply for jobs

---

## Discuss with the learners

- Why do some projects not have a website?
- Why is project documentation important?
- What are the features of a useful documentation?
- Why are some projects lacking useful documentation
- How can we motivate developers to contribute to the documentation?

---

## Typical problems

- Many scientific websites look like websites created by scientists in the 90s
- Websites which are not suitable for phones
- Parts of the documentation are outdated/incomplete
  - Lance Armstrong: "It's not the bike it's the rider."
  - Concerning documentation, sometimes it is not the rider, it is the bike
  - Some projects simply use better tools
  - It is not always the lazy programmer, sometimes it is the framework
  - If the documentation is notoriously outdated/incomplete, it can mean
    that your documentation framework/workflow is not ideal
- Documentation workflows undocumented
- We typically program first and document later (or never)
- No manual for developers (first steps, call tree, where to start, what to do and what not to do)
- One documentation for different versions (either just confusing or documentation for
  older versions is just dropped)
- Have to read a lot of text in different places just to get started
- Keyword-driven (what is possible) instead of tutorial-driven (what is recommended)
- With some projects it is impossible to get a result after 5 minutes of reading
- Some scientific projects take pride in being inaccessible, hard to understand, undocumented, opaque
