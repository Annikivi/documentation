## Good practices (1/2)

- Whatever solution you choose, make it automatically rebuild pages upon `git push`
- If you need to ask somebody to run some scripts on the server after you have modified sources,
  that will not work in practice (does not scale)
- Answer questions with an URL to (updated) documentation
    - Email answers get lost/forgotten
    - Answer and improve doc at the same time
    - Long-term lazy
    - Chance is that next time the user/colleague
      will find the answer by him/herself
    - Trains people to read the doc

## Good practices (2/2)

- Write documentation that you would like to read
- When using code review make sure that new functionality always comes with documentation
- Some people who install and test the software know nothing about the theory behind the code
    - Busy user support at computing centers
    - Vendors who run benchmarks
- Market success stories (pictures, scaling, molecules, be proud)
