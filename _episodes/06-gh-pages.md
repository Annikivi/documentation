## Create an example project website and host it on GitHub Pages

In this demo we will create a very simple project website and host it on [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/). [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/) and [Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/publishing-a-website-on-bitbucket-cloud-221449776.html) also offer a
very similar solution. The key is that you can give the hosting to
professionals so that you can focus on your project.

It is no problem to use a custom domain instead of `*.github.io`.

This is how all
[https://coderefinery.org](https://coderefinery.org)
material is hosted.

### Context

- We will use a particular framework: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) which generates HTML from Markdown.
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is one out of many possible tools (static site generators, more on this later).
- The point of this exercise is not to focus on Jekyll or Markdown but to demonstrate that
  **you can serve webpages via GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket pages**.
- If we wanted we could serve HTML generated by Sphinx from previous exercise via GitHub pages instead
  of Read the Docs.
- You can also write HTML directly if you prefer.

> ## Exercice: let us try it out!
>
> - First import [https://github.com/coderefinery/gh-pages-example](https://github.com/coderefinery/gh-pages-example) and clone the example repository.
> ```shell
> $ git clone https://github.com/user/gh-pages-example.git  # adapt user
> $ cd gh-pages-example
> ```
> - Check that you are indeed on the `gh-pages` branch.
> - Make some changes to `index.md` or `about.md` or `team.md`, commit and push.
> ```shell
> $ git add index.md team.md  # add changes to commit
> $ git commit -m "modified website contents"
> $ git push origin gh-pages
> ```
> - Verify that your changes land on `https://<user>.github.io/gh-pages-example/` (it may take a couple of seconds).
>
> Yay! Now you have successfully deployed a website!

### Discussion

What just happened?
- We have used [GitHub Pages supported themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/).
- We have defined the theme we want to use in the file `_config.yml`.
- Each Markdown file started with [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

GitHub generated HTML from the Markdown files - see the
[documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-jekyll-theme-to-your-github-pages-site/).

GitHub pages typically use the branch `gh-pages` but can be configured to also serve directly from the `master` branch
under `docs/` - see the [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/).

---

### Sphinx or GitHub pages or both?

- GitHub pages typically serves one version (one branch). It is often used as the project/group/personal page.
- Sphinx can serve several versions (several branches/tags) at the same time.
- Some projects use both.
- It is a good idea to keep source code, web sources, and possibly also Sphinx source all in the same repository, tracking a common history.

### Where you might want to go from here

- There are many web frameworks available.
- **Static site generators**
  (such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), [Hexo](https://hexo.io), ...)
  allow modular websites and play well with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket Pages which serve static sites.
- See the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://pages.github.com) for step-by-step guides.
- It is no problem to serve GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket Pages using your **own domain name**.
- For styling of your website you can use one of the many CSS frameworks (such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com),
  [Bulma](https://bulma.io), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), ...)
