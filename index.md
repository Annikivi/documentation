# Code documentation lesson

In this lesson we will discuss different solutions for implementing and
deploying code documentation.

We will learn how to build documentation with the
**documentation generator** [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) (and compare it
with others) and how to
deploy it to [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org), a service which hosts
open documentation for free.

This demonstration will be **independent of programming languages** and relevant
also for your Fortran, C, C++, R, or Matlab projects.

We will also learn how
to deploy a **project website or personal homepage** to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
The approach that we will learn will be transferable to
[GitLab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/) and
[Bitbucket Pages](https://pages.bitbucket.io).

> ## Prerequisites
>
> 1. Basic understanding of Git.
>
> 2. You need to have [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) installed (as part of your Python environment installation).
>
> 3. You need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account (if you want to deploy the documentation via GitHub).
