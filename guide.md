# Instructor guide

### How to start

Here can be a starting anecdote or a starting question.


### Questions to involve participants

Here list a couple of questions that can be asked to
wake participants up.


### Timing

Give hints on timing.


### Core aspects

- Versionned and close to the code
- Sphinx is not only for Python


### Sessions which can be skipped if time is tight

List optional sessions here.


### Typical pitfalls

#### Anaconda shell, Git, and Nano on Windows

Windows users (probably) need to use the Anaconda prompt to run sphinx commands
(sphinx-build, sphinx-quickstart). Git seems to be present in the standard
anaconda installation, but not nano.

A good working solution seems to be that Windows users have two terminals
side-by-side, one with Anaconda prompt and another with git-bash.
